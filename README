Better Storage Widget

A project to learn android widget 

The basic idea:
- Provide a widget to display storage info on homescreen
- Show each available storage unit (phone, sdcard) as progress bar
  (++++++++ Free / Total ++-----)

Advanced:
- Support common cloud storage (dropbox, gdrive, skydrive etc)

Update 2012/11/22:
- Basic framework done. Crash on adding widget (WidgetConfigure not working)
