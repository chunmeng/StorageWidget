Better Storage Widget

A project to learn android widget 

The basic idea:
- Provide a widget to display storage info on homescreen
- Show each available storage unit (phone, sdcard) as progress bar
  Data   (++++++++ % Free / Total ++-----)
  System (++++++++ % Free / Total ++-----)
  SDCard (++++++++ % Free / Total ++-----)

Advanced:
- Support common cloud storage (dropbox, gdrive, skydrive etc)

Update 2012/12/15:
Release 1.0.3
- Fix a JB crash (due to new path /storage/emulated/0)
- Partial external SD card support 

Known issue:
- If the external card is already seated, it's not detected (the widget only detect it by receiving mount/unmount event)
- Sometime the External SD card would display when the widget refresh itself  

Release 1.0.2 
- Additional layout and UI change
  > Added custom progress bar
  > Added storage icon (using icon set from Origami colored pencil set: http://www.iconfinder.com/browse/iconset/colorful/). May change again.
- Media mount broadcast receiver (not complete)

Update 2012/11/24:
- Issues:
  1. Long overflow in totalBytes calculation
  2. Progressbar too thin
  3. Problem loading widget after a while 

Update 2012/11/22:
- Basic framework done. Crash on adding widget (WidgetConfigure not working)
